# Hospital-Network-Simulation-SQL

• Designed and implemented a relational database schema for a hypothetical healthcare research network
using MySQL Workbench, modeling complex entities and relationships across hospitals, patients, staffs,
research projects, and funding foundations with appropriate foreign key constraints and normalization

• Enforced integrity constraints (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, CHECK, and UNIQUE) across 20+
Interrelated tables to reflect real-world access control, medical care, and research sponsorship logic

• Developed test scripts to validate referential integrity, entity-level constraints, and complex business rules
(e.g., application-level date checks, minimum participation requirements) using INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE,
and SELECT queries for consistent verification and error handling
